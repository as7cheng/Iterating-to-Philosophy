Introduction

This Assignment involves developing increasingly general Iterators using both the Iterator and Iterable interfaces from the Java API. Rather than iterating through a pre-existing collection of data, your code will be generating this data on demand. The final generalization of this pattern will be used to explore the structure of Wikipedia and the significance of its Philosophy page.
